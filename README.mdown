Vim syntax highlighting for OpenCL. The script currently supports
both the OpenCL runtime functions and the OpenCL language.

By default, it only highlights with the `.cl` extension, but if
you want all C files to be highlighted, you can set them like so

    autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.h,*.c setfiletype opencl
